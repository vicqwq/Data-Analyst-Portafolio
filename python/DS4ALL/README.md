# DS4ALL

This project was part of the DS4ALL program, where we used a LSTM neural network to make short terms predictions and long term estimates of the cost of energy in Colombia using public data from XM website (https://www.xm.com.co).

Details of the model can be found in the file "ds4all_report", also a notebook with the model is found in "modelo3_simplificado_comentado" file.
