# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock

This project involves the implementation of a trainable machine learning model designed for image recognition to play the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. The model is deployed on an HTML file, allowing users to leverage their camera to provide examples of each sign in the game. With the captured data, users can train the model and make predictions. For optimal results, it is recommended to showcase 30-50 pictures of each sign in various positions during the training process. The trained model can be downloaded for further use.
